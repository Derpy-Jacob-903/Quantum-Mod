This mod is (vaguely) based around Quantum (&Nucear) stuff, as you can tell by the name. 
What does this mod add:
100+ Jokers
10+ Consumables
1 edition (currently)
5+ Decks
10+ Seals
4 Vouchers

Additional:
all cards are undiscovered to provide at least 
a semblence of a challange in finding them all.

Fun Fact:
This mod started out as a herdcode project, but it was ABSOLUTE
AGONY to hardcode, scince there was basically NO documentation.
So this new version is made in Jokerforge.
